Purpose of Header/Tailer in PDU?|__def-ans__|exact structure varies; however the purpose is always the same regardless of whether it's a datagram, frame, packet, segment, etc... PROVIDES protocol-specific metadata about the PDU|__card__|Agent of data encapsulation?|__def-ans__|PDU of more abstract layer becomes entire data payload of current layer PDU|__card__|What's the relationship between protocols at different 'layers' ?|__def-ans__|a protocol at a lower layer provides a service to the immediate protocol above it. e.g. the datalink layer protocol provides a service to the network layer protocol (data encapsulation in data payload of network layer's PDU)|__card__|What's the PDU of the physical layer?|__def-ans__|bits|__card__|what is a bandwidth bottleneck?|__def-ans__|a point where bandwidth changes from relatively high to low|__card__|What are the two important aspects of the protocol at the datalink layer?|__def-ans__|framing & addressing (ethernet)|__card__|What is the "lowest" layer at which data encapsulation occurs?|__def-ans__|datalink layer (ethernet protocol)|__card__|Most important aspect of the purpose of ethernet frames in terms of mental model?|__def-ans__|Ethernet frames are structured data; as opposed to a stream of bits (at the physical level). Important components: Source and Destination MAC address and data payload|__card__|What is a MAC address?|__def-ans__|Media Access Control Address, 6 two-digit hexadecimal numbers, linked to a specific device|__card__|What's a meaningful difference between a network hub and network switch?|__def-ans__|hubs transmit messages to all connected devices on the local network, switches use a destination address to direct a frame to a specific device|__card__|What is a core difference between MAC addresses and IP addresses in terms of their structure?|__def-ans__|MAC addresses are "flat" (e.g. non-hierarchical) and as such cannot be broken down into subdivisions like an IP address + port number id can. Additionally, IP addresses are logical in nature, meaning that they aren't tied to any one device and are assigned and used on an as-needed basis|__card__|What's the main conceptual limitation of MAC addresses that prevents them from being used much beyond connecting devices on a local network?|__def-ans__|Mainly issues of scalability; there's simply too many devices in the world that the way that MAC addresses are stored in tables on routers, thus these tables would need to be infinitely large to support all possible connections|__card__|What is subnetting? What purpose does it serve?|__def-ans__|the division of a network into parts, allowing for more hierarchy|__card__|What two header fields are present in both TCP and UDP PDUS?|__def-ans__|Source IP address and Destination IP address|__card__|Why are there so many different protocols? (2 main reasons)|__def-ans__|1) need be able to address diff. aspects of communication (e.g. message structure vs flow or order). HTTP (an application layer protocol) vs Ethernet (a network layer protocol) perform different tasks that facilitate communication at their respective layers
2) need to be able to address the same aspect of network communication in a different manner (e.g. prioritize simplicity (low latency apps like Zoom) vs prioritize connection integrity (high latency)). UDP vs TCP is one example of this|__card__|What is a potential downside to TCP's in-order delivery?|__def-ans__|head-of-line blocking; if a segment is lost, ensuing segments must wait their turn (adding queuing delay); thus adding more latency to the data transfer

this is one of the major tradeoffs of using TCP over UDP|__card__|What are the main trade-offs of using TCP?|__def-ans__|1) increased latency as a result of the three-way handshake process (ie. establishing a reliable connection)
2) head-of-line blocking as a result of in-order delivery|__card__|Multiplexing:|__def-ans__|whereby a host (client or server; a device) processes signals from all ports and prepares them for transmission over a single channel

occurs in the transport layer|__card__|describe the steps immediately following a returned `302` status code|__def-ans__|-|__card__|What are some differences when using a web browser versus using an HTTP tool like Paw 3?|__def-ans__|- Paw 3 doesn't automatically issue a new request when a 302 status response
- browser automatically requests all referenced resources (dependancies)|__card__|Is IP (internet protocol) a connectionless protocol? Why or why not?|__def-ans__|IP is connectionless; there is no synchronization or acknowledgement|__card__|What are the fundamental elements required for reliable data transfer?|__def-ans__|1) in-order delivery
2) error detection
3) handling lost data
4) de-duplication|__card__|What are 4 core fields of a TCP segment that relate to implementing reliability?|__def-ans__|1) checksum
2) sequence number
3) Syn/Ack
4) WINDOW SIZE|__card__|What is meant by "connection-oriented" in relation to TCP? Further, what tradeoff is made with being "connection-oriented"?|__def-ans__|As a protocol, TCP is connection-oriented; it doesn't start sending data until a connection has been established between two application processes. Following a successful three-way handshake, data can be sent. The additional roundtrip latency hampers the performance of some network application.|__card__|What are some of benefits and challenges of HTTP being a stateless protocol?|__def-ans__|some benefits are that the server doesn't have to hold on to state information|__card__|What does it mean when we say that Http is a resilient protocol?|__def-ans__|-|__card__|What is the major benefit to how the data payload implements encapsulation?|__def-ans__|mainly: separation of the various protocols at the various "layers". Due to encapsulation, protocols don't need to know the specifics of another protocol's implementation to interact with it (the data). A lower layer protocol only needs to know that it should provide a service (encapsulation) to the protocol above it. Additionally, it provides a certain level of abstraction; which helps the developer to build a useful mental model.|__card__|What's the default port number for HTTP requests?|__def-ans__|80|__card__|Ports identify specific services running on our host device. how do they assist/facilitate multiplexing and demultiplexing?|__def-ans__|The source port and destination port numbers are headers in the transport layer's PDU (both for UDP's datagram and TCP's segment) and thus provide the necessary information to connect the two endpoints of the application layer communications (socket = IP address + port number)|__card__|What is a security risk that can circumvent the same origin policy? What are two ways we can protect against this security risk?|__def-ans__|Cross-site scripting; whereby some html or javascript is injected into a site via some user-input (like filling out a form or leaving a comment in the form of some text). The server side code must implement some sort of input sanitization to prevent this malicious html/js from being interpreted and executed by the client (eg. browser). Additionally, we can implement 'escaping', which essentially entails telling the client to display the user input as is (e.g. as raw html or javascript; essentially just plain text) instead of interpreting it as html or js and attempting to execute said code.|__card__|What are Certificate Authorities?|__def-ans__|trustworthy entities which issue, revoke, and manage digital certificates (also known as Root (highest) authority)|__card__|What is the purpose of the chain of trust?|__def-ans__|Security. The private keys of the Root CAs are behind many layers of security. If an intermediate CA becomes compromised then the Root CA can simply revoke it (and all others down the chain) and issue a new certificate.|__card__|How are the end of headers indicated in HTTP/1.1?|__def-ans__|with an empty line|__card__|what is an example of a speculative optimization in the context of web browsers?|__def-ans__|pre-rendering a page that is frequently visited; a TCP connection is opened in anticipation of an http request when a user hovers a hyperlink. Essentially, the browser 'learns' over time based on user behavior.|__card__|When a CA issues a certificate, what two important things occur?|__def-ans__|1) identifies the requesting party; ensures they're who they say they are
2) digitally "signs" the issued certificate; often entails encrypting some data with the CA's private key and using this data as a "signature"|__card__|What is Cross-site scripting?|__def-ans__|XSS is an injection vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can insert unauthorized JavaScript, VBScript, HTML, or other active content into a web page. It allows an attacker to bypass the browser's security mechanisms by injecting scripts into a web app server which is then interpreted by the browser as coming from that app server. When other users view the page, the malicious code executes and affects or attacks the user in some way. For example, a malicious script can hijack the user's session (session hijacking), submit unauthorized transactions as the users, steal confidential information, or simply deface the page.|__card__|What is a digital certificate?|__def-ans__|a notice that guarantees a user or a website is legitimate. Is comparable to a signature by some online entity.|__card__|What's the purpose of the TCP handshake?|__def-ans__|establish a meaningful connection between services on different host devices.|__card__|URI ?|__def-ans__|uniform resource identifier. a string of characters which identify some resource in some information space (like the web); provides _address uniformity_. Among other characteristics, URI includes network location info for some resource in the a space.|__card__|What are the core advantages of connection-oriented protocols like TCP ?|__def-ans__|three main ones: ensures in-order delivery, message received acknowledgement, and retransmission assurance (for dropped packets/frames). All of which provide the foundations for reliable communication.|__card__|General purpose of Headers and Trailers in the context of a PDU?|__def-ans__|-> to provide additional context (meta-data) to the PDu of a specific protocol|__card__|Where would an application's business logic likely reside?|__def-ans__|Application server. This is typically where server-side code lives when deployed. The application server will then utilize some persistent data store like a relational database to retrieve static assets or create data|__card__|Which specific PDU involves the SEQUENCE NUMBER and ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER headers? Which important processes do these fields facilitate?|__def-ans__|TCP segments! Used jointly, these fields facilitate reliability processes such as in-order delivery, de-duplication, and retransmission of lost packets|__card__|What is pipelining?|__def-ans__|at the transport layer, pipelining entails ???

as it pertains to the application layer, pipelining is the process to send successive http requests, over the same persistent connection, without waiting for the answer|__card__|Simple definition of Integrity in the context of security?|__def-ans__|a process to detect whether a message has been interfered with or faked.|__card__|Which "layer" of the TCP/IP model are routers a core technology ?|__def-ans__|Internet layer; frames travel from router to router, opened up at each router where the encapsulated data (IP packet), data is inspected and routed to the closest router|__card__|describe the difference between the two "MAC" acronyms|__def-ans__|One (message authentication code) is used within the context of TLS (as a field in the TLS record PDU) and is involved in the Authentication services provided by TLS. Serves a similar purpose as a checksum field of a different PDU|__card__|What is a protocol data unit?|__def-ans__|A protocol data unit (PDU) represents a specific set of data at each layer of a model, like OSI. particular examples include: frames, packets, segments, datagrams, tls records, etc...|__card__|Describe the purpose of source/destination MAC addresses within the context of the Data Link/Link layer.|__def-ans__|Source/destination MAC addresses are part of the header of the PDU of the Datalink layer (frames!) and serve to provide node-to-node connection.|__card__|Is there a meaningful difference between a _scheme_ and a _protocol_?|__def-ans__|Yes. within the context of a url, a scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access some resource|__card__|Is a TLS certificate all you need to ensure authentication?|__def-ans__|No. Certificates are publicly available to all. This is where Certificate Authorities come in.|__card__|IP (internet layer protocol) gets us pretty far, but in order to create networked applications, what are the two most important things we need?|__def-ans__|Direct connections between applications and reliable network connections|__card__|what are the two most important aspects of Ethernet for our purposes at LS?|__def-ans__|framing and addressing

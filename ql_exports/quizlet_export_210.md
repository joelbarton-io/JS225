!!!! What factors determine the scope of a variable?|__def-ans__|1. HOW the variable is declared (let, const, var, global)

2. WHERE that variable is declared|__card__|"block scoped"|__def-ans__|a variable which is block scoped is only visible within the block where it was declared. Examples are variables declared with `let` and `const`|__card__|"element, property, component, attribute, method, function"|__def-ans__||__card__|"enumerability" as it pertains to properties in object.|__def-ans__||__card__|"function scoped"|__def-ans__|a variable which is function scoped is visible in the context of the function where it was declared. Example are variables defined with `var` or `function`|__card__|>>>>What is in a closure?|__def-ans__|a function and any variables (specifically, a reference to the variable name) that the function uses upon invocation|__card__|a function is said to ______ ______|__def-ans__|"have returned" rather than "finished executing"

mainly to do with disambiguating a "return value" and "when a function returns"|__card__|are arithmetic operators useful when working with arrays?|__def-ans__|no, while they can operate on arrays (indirectly, their values) they don't perform very helpful or predictable behaviors thus avoid! They don't throw any sort of errors or messages and thus the unexpected/unuseful behavior flies under the radar.|__card__|Are closures a lexical feature or a runtime feature of the JS engine?|__def-ans__|While technically they involve runtime features, it's easier to think of closures as being a purely lexical feature, which is to say that closure definitions are an artifact of the STRUCTURE of a program and NOT a result of running your code.|__card__|Can two returned functions close over the same local variable?|__def-ans__|Yes. The resulting behavior will be that the variable is shared between the two functions. If the variable's value changes as a result of f1, this change will be reflected in any further actions affected by f2.|__card__|comparing an array with something else (non array) results in the array's elements being converted to a string, then compared to the non array, and so on|__def-ans__||__card__|declare vs define vs initialize w/r/t variables, what's the difference?|__def-ans__||__card__|define "destructuring"|__def-ans__|a syntactic sugar which lets us declare multiple variables in a concise, single line form
let {a, b, c, d, e} = obj

here we assume that object has some similarly named properties from which to gather values to initialize the local variables in between the { } braces|__card__|define "expression"|__def-ans__|An expression is anything that JavaScript can evaluate to a value, even if that value is undefined or null.

example: 3 * 5|__card__|define "silent error"|__def-ans__|occur when a program does something that is unintended, but continues to run as though nothing is wrong. This can lead to incorrect results or errors much later in execution that are subsequently difficult to track down.|__card__|define "statement"|__def-ans__|Statements often include expressions as part of their syntax, but the statement itself is not an expression -- its value cannot be captured and reused later in your code.

 example: variable declaration|__card__|define "strict mode"|__def-ans__|an optional mode that modifies the semantics of JavaScript and prevents certain kinds of errors and syntax.

it is 'lexically scoped', so it only applies to the context (and nested contexts) which enables it

You can also pass too many arguments, Javascript will ignore the excess arguments*|__card__|Does strict mode enforce strict arity for user-defined functions?|__def-ans__|strict mode does not enforce strict arity; the code will run without throwing an error|__card__|explain what the following does: `let someVar;`|__def-ans__||__card__|How do functions and classes interact with hoisting? How do they differ?|__def-ans__||__card__|How do var and let Differ?|__def-ans__|`let` is safer than `var` when in the the global (top-level) scope of a program since, when we declare and initialize a variable with`var`, we create a property on the `global` object (e.g. global.foo). This is not the case with variables declared with `let`.|__card__|How do var, let, and const interact with hoisting? How do they differ?|__def-ans__||__card__|how do we distinguish between array destructuring and array literal syntax?|__def-ans__||__card__|How does hoisting really work?|__def-ans__||__card__|How does hoisting work in the context of a for loop? Does `let index` get hoisted during the creation phase?|__def-ans__|Yes.

`index` is hoisted to the top of the enclosing lexical scope, meaning that, prior to code execution and its assignment, `index` references `undefined`|__card__|How does one create a deep-copy?|__def-ans__|let arr = [{ b: 'foo' }, ['bar']];
let serializedArr = JSON.stringify(arr);

- Every block creates a new local variable scope.
- Lexical scope uses the structure of the source code to determine the variable's scope. This means that the code doesn't have to be executed for the scope to exist.
- All variables in the same or surrounding scopes are visible inside functions and blocks.|__card__|In Javascript, what can `[...]` mean in various contexts?|__def-ans__|- array literal syntax: creating a new array object
- as an operator
- for array destructuring

Why or why not?|__def-ans__||__card__|Is it possible to deep-clone a Date object? What sort of objects can utilize deep-clone functionality?|__def-ans__|No. not possible. Only plain objects and nested arrays can be deep cloned.|__card__|is Length a property or an method (in the context of Strings and Arrays)?|__def-ans__||__card__|is there a meaningful difference between `String` and `""` ?|__def-ans__|`String` is a built-in object provided by JS whereas `"'` is a primitive string value.

When we use a String method like `String.prototype.toUpperCase('hi')` we are invoking `toUpperCase` upon the string object, NOT the primitive string value `'hi'`.

This demonstrates JS' behavior of TEMPORARILY coercing primitive values to their object counterpart in order to access (and execute) the functionality which is provided by said object counterpart upon the primitive value.|__card__|Is there a meaningful difference between a global variable and a property on the global object? (relate this to `var` vs an erroneous undeclared variable)|__def-ans__|Sort of, they're functionally the same. However, "all properties of the global object can be spoken of as global variables, but not all global variables are properties of the global object. If you declare a variable that has global scope with let, const, or class, it will be a global variable, but it won't be a property of the global object."

ex: let declared in the global scope isn't a property on the global object but it IS a global variable since it was declared in the global scope! The same is true for a variable declared with const in the global scope.|__card__|Is there a meaningful difference between how the local variable that is used to reference a function expression and the local variable that references a function declaration are hoisted?|__def-ans__|Yes.

When the local variable of a function expression is hoisted, only the local variable name is hoisted (sans function body). This is not the case for a function statement (declaration), in this case the local variable AND the function body are both hoisted to the top of their respective scope|__card__|is there a meaningful difference re: the hoisting process of local variables declared with var vs let?|__def-ans__||__card__|negative indices in arrays? how does this work?|__def-ans__||__card__|practice all the ways to go from values or variables to an array (e.g. from, push, literal, Array()|__def-ans__||__card__|PRACTICE LOGICAL OPERATORS!|__def-ans__||__card__|property VS method???|__def-ans__||__card__|re: "global variables"|__def-ans__|an undeclared variable which is initialized is a global variable, which is to say that the undeclared variable is a property on the global object which behaves like a global variable.

dont use global variables willy-nilly, it leads to bugs and makes overwriting a variable intended to be accessible globally far too easy

When a variable declared with `let`/`const` is hoisted, it's initial value is "not defined" (the Temporal Dead Zone or TDZ)

this is why we can access (essentially, reference) a non-initialized variable declared with `var`; once hoisted, the value it references is `undefined`|__card__|What concept does this code snippet demonstrate?

> "objects linking other objects"

- one of the two "JavaScript best practices" approaches to implementing inheritance and behavior sharing in JS
- a very straight-forward way to implement prototypal inheritance
- sheds the pretense of "classes" and instead just uses objects (no constructor functions) + `Object.create()` + `init`
